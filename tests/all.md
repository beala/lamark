#A Markdown Document#
Here's some *normal* markdown\blog post. Now we're going to try some latex.

Here we go:

{% latex title="My_Equation" alt_text="Some text" %}
Here's some latex.
\{% endlatex%}
{% endlatex %}

And here's some {%latex title="eq"%}inline latex{%endlatex %}.

Here we're going to escape a latex tag \{%latex title="TITLE OF IMAGE" alt="Some alt text" %}\{%endlatex%}
