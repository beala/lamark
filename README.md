#Introduction
LaMark is a tool for embedding LaTeX equations in Markdown files. It is designed as a companion to Markdown blogging platforms such as Octopress and Jekyll.

Here is an example of a LaMark file: https://github.com/beala/lamark/blob/master/lamark/test/functional/demo.lm

And the cooresponding HTML: http://media.usrsb.in/lamark-demo/demo.html

#Overview
LaMark allows LaTeX to be embedded in Markdown files. Running a mixed LaTeX/Markdown file (called a LaMark file) through the LaMark processor will result in a pure Markdown file, along with a set of images that correspond to the embedded LaTeX. For example, consider this LaMark file:

```
#Some LaTeX
{% latex "http://media.usrsb.in/" %}
a^2+b^2=c^2
{% end %}

{% latex "http://media.usrsb.in/" imgName="one-half.png" %}
\frac{1}{2}
{% end %}
```

Running this through the LaMark processor will result in:

```
#Some LaTeX
![http://media.usrsb.in/0.png](http://media.usrsb.in/0.png)

![http://media.usrsb.in/one-half.png](http://media.usrsb.in/one-half.png)
```

Along with two image files: `0.png` and `one-half.png`

Using the command line tool is easy. Process a LaMark file named `example.lm` with:

```
python lamark.py -f example.lm -o markdown.md
```

Or convert straight to HTML using the [reference implementation of Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):

```
python lamark.py -f example.lm | ./Markdown.pl > example.html
```

#Installation

`pip install lamark`

#Usage
Following Octopress's lead, LaMark tags are wrapped in a bracket and percent sign as follows:

```
{% latex %} [LaTeX] {% end %}
```

LaMark tags also accept positional and keyword arguments. The positional arguments must come before the keyword arguments:

```
{% latex "http://media.usrsb.in/" "pythag.png" imgZoom="3000" %}
a^2+b^2=c^2
{% end %}
```

Where `http://media.usrsb.in/` is path to the image, which will be used in the resultant Markdown file, `pythag.png` is the name of the image that will be generated, and `3000` is the `zoom` parameter that dvipng uses to size the image. The syntax is as follows:

```
{% latex [path [alt [imgZoom [imgName]]]] %}
[LaTeX]
{% end %}
```

The syntax for the keyword arguments is:

```
{% latex [ARG_NAME="ARG_VALUE"] %}
[LaTeX]
{% end %}
```

Where the possible arguments are:

- `path`: The path to the image used in the Markdown image tag.
- `alt`: The alt text used in the Markdown image tag.
- `imgName`: The image name for the generated image, including extension (eg, `my-image.png`)
- `imgZoom`: The zoom parameter used by `dvipng`, which coorresponds to the dimensions of the generated image. `2000` is the default value. Larger values result in larger images (more zoomed in).

As stated above, positional and keyword arguments can be used together, but the positional arguments must come first:

```
{%latex [POSITIONAL ARGS] [KEYWORD_ARGS] %}
[LaTeX]
{%end%}
```

LaMark does its best to be flexible, and allow for whitespace in tags. The following is valid LaMark:

```
{% latex
            "http://media.usrsb.in/"
            "Some LaTeX"                                                          imgZoom="2500"
            %}a^2
            {%end            %}
```



In short, most sensible (and some wacky) whitespacing styles are valid.

LaMark tags can be escaped with a backslash. Consider the following LaMark:

```
\{%latex%}
a^2
\{%end%}
```

This will be rendered as:

```
{%latex%}
a^2
{%end%}
```

Backslashes are only escape characters if they come before a LaMark tag. In all other cases, they carry no special meaning and will be left alone by the LaMark processor.

Using the command line tool is self-explanatory:

```
% python lamark.py -h
usage: lamark.py [-h] -f FILE [-o FILE] [-i DIR] [--debug] [--warn]

A LaTeX processor for Markdown

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -f FILE     LaMark input file. '-' for stdin.
  -o FILE     Markdown output file. Images will be placed in same directory
              unless overridden with -i. Defaults to stdout, in which case
              images will be placed in the pwd.
  -i DIR      Image directory.
  --debug     Turn on debug messages.
  --warn      Turn on warning messages.
```

#Dependencies
